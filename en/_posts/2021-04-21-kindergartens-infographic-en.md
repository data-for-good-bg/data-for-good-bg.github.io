With the addition of criteria for settlement for the admission of children to kindergartens and nurseries many parents who have lived for over 3 years in Sofia hoped for a higher chance to get a place for their children in a kindergarten.
The standard maximum number of points by general criteria this year is 13. However, is it enough to have 13 points for a child to be admitted to a kindergarten or a nursery in Sofia from the first round?
This is what Magdalena Petrova, a volunteer in Data for Good - Bulgaria and a Data Scientist in maternity leave, decided to check.

### How was the data processed?
The data has been taken from the Information System for Servicing Children's Institutions (in Bulgarian - Информационна система за обслужване на детските заведения, ИСОДЗ) and is up to date as of April 19, 2021. The data about free places by region, institution, and group for the children born in 2020, 2019, and 2018, as well as the applications of children as of April 19, 2021, has been processed using Python. Each child has been counted once with their maximum number of points for the region they reside. As the infographic aims to provide a general overview, it does not take into account free places by social criteria and chronic diseases.
