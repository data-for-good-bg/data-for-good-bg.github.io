# Forms of participation in Data for Good

# Members

Members are people who want to have a systematic engagement with the organisation and its development, working on specific data science tasks is only part of this process. As a member, you actively participate in building the image of the association and give substance to that image.

# Volunteers

As a Data for Good volunteer, you have the opportunity to work on specific tasks that have already been defined by us. We get involved in the organisation and scoping of the project, and you can get on with solving a specific problem.  The tasks will be tailored to your expertise and capabilities. 

Although the main activity of the organization is data work, for the successful completion of the tasks and for the development of the Association we need volunteers with experience in design, communication and project management.

**Who can volunteer?** - Anyone who is willing.

**How to volunteer?** 
- There is no need for a formal application and no selection criteria for in-house tasks. 
- Selection when working on a specific project for another organisation: interview and short assignment. Volunteers without much experience can get mentoring and support from more experienced members and volunteers.

**What does it mean to be a volunteer at Data for Good Bulgaria?**

Volunteering consists of working on specific tasks related to data processing and analysis, as well as visualization and communication of the results.
The projects are carried out in partnership with people who have experience in a given sector (education, environment, etc.) which allows for a deeper understanding of its issues as well as validation of the conclusions drawn.
Depending on the project and the preferences of the volunteer, the work can be carried out in a team with other volunteers or alone.

**What are the benefits of volunteering?** 
- Contribution to real and socially relevant tasks ;
- Opportunity to gain experience by solving interesting problems ;
- A blog post on the Association's website reflecting individual contributions ;
- Participation in a community sharing similar values.
