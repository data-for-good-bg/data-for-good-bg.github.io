## For Beneficiaries

If you represent an NGO looking to solve a challenge for the public benefit using data, we will help you organize, analyze and understand your data. We help you understand the data requirements of your project, develop a data acquisition and protection strategy and link you with volunteers who can bring your vision to life.

## Our process

### Scope the Challenge
We approach your challenge from the lens of data to understand. the data and solution requirements. Our main objective is to help you make a positive lasting impact, understanding the challenge inside-out is our first step.

### Data Collection & Processing Strategy
We understand social problems come with sensitive information. In many cases, data acquisition and processing is even harder than a standard data project. We carefully design data collection strategy and curate data sources where needed. We help beneficiaries build an understanding of these concepts while actively building projects.

### Project Development & Delivery
We match you with volunteers to build the designed solution. We actively work with beneficiaries to make sure we are working towards the same goal. We provide the technical resources and services, while the project is managed jointly by the beneficiary and DfG.
